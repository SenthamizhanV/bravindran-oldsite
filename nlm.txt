Natural Languages and Media Laboratory

The NLM lab was established in 1999. The genesis of this lab can be traced to the initial research work carried out by the group, since 1990. Starting with the issues related to translation between Indian languages, the group got interested in the application of Natural Language techniques in representation and retrieval of Video data through an analysis of the contents. Employing both semi-automatic and automatic methods, and extending the approach from sports to agricultural applications the data from video and text media were handled. Currently the focus is on the development of appropriate knowledge representation tools for data useful for various language-oriented applications.

The NLP approach is looked at as an efficient alternative for content-based access, especially since audio and video processing techniques have not sufficiently advanced to the level of identifying the information content, which is at a higher level, from the data captured at lower levels by the devices. The factors which have motivated the current research activities are:

    (a) proliferation of the devices which, of late, are becoming highly portable,
    (b) localization of the applications, on one hand, and
    (c) globalization of markets on the other hand. 

Thus, there is a great need for a quick transformation of data to information, which can be understood by people speaking different languages. Research leading to knowledge representation which makes use of languages understood by many can make useful contributions.
